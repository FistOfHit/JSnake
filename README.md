A VERY light weight game of snake made in plain JavaScript for a bit of fun when you're bored and there is no internet. Made after 
watching <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs&list=WL&index=1">this</a> video on Youtube by Gamkedo. Obviously, I've 
changed the code a fair amount to make things less "hacky" and clearer, but it's still nevertheless very simple and quick to run. 

## Requirements and Installation ## 

Only need to have an internet browser (works in Chrome, not sure about IE), and about 2KB of free space.

Just clone/download/Ctrl+c-Ctrl+v and open in your browser

## Usage ## 

Playing is very simple, simply use the 4 arrow keys (up, down, left and right) to control the snake. Hitting the walls means you'll 
teleport to the other side and continue in the same direction. The aim is to collect and eat the red apples to grow (1 unit per apple 
eaten) and make progress. The catch is that if you turn back on yourself or collide into your own body, you will restart from being 5 
units long. 

## Contributing ##

There really isn't much to add if you only want to play, but if you want to add features to the game that dont require any libraries or 
super-genius tricks, feel free to take the code and build upon it. Perhaps keep a watch on this repository to have the latest version of 
the game!

## Credits ##

The idea and methods I used are learnt from Gamkedo's Youtube <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs&list=WL&index=1"> 
video</a> and so credit should go to him for this concept.
